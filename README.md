# solar-themed-doxygen

This is a personal work on Doxygen CSS, with a light solarized theme.
Colors were copied from Matt Harzewski's work for Jekyll (https://github.com/mattvh/solar-theme-jekyll).

## Changes with respect to the original Doxygen theme

* Background color
* Title color
* Larger and monospace fonts for the list of attributes and methods
* Rounded corners in the detailed presentation of attributes and members
* For pages generated without the tree view, the search box has fixed coordinates instead of absolute coordinates
(i.e. it follows you when you scroll down)

I recommend activating the tree view whenever possible.
